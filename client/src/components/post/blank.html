        <span class="white">Hi, I'm Blix, and I'm really eager to kickstart a career in computer
            science. I find myself at a bit of a crossroads and could use some advice. I'm wondering,
            how do I get started in this field? What track should I focus onâ€”web development, artificial
            intelligence, or maybe cybersecurity? The possibilities seem endless, and I'm both excited
            and a bit overwhelmed. If anyone has some guidance on how to navigate this journey and make
            meaningful choices, I'd greatly appreciate it!</span>
